The perfect office would have lots and lots of plants, along with:
fresh air
natural light
sit/stand desks
a nap room
good coffee
a budget for little niceties like pepper
brightly colored walls or art
6 hour workdays
privacy
no weird smells
co-workers who talk in a normal tone of voice
This would be my perfect office.
